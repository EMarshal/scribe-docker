# scribe-docker

A CI process to build OCI images for [Scribe - An Alternative Medium Frontend](https://sr.ht/~edwardloveall/Scribe/).

I'll typically build and push images for the most recent versioned release: [Scribe refs](https://git.sr.ht/~edwardloveall/scribe/refs)

Also see the [Scribe CHANGELOG](https://git.sr.ht/~edwardloveall/scribe/tree/main/item/CHANGELOG).
